            <p>Until the period of European colonization, Argentina was relatively sparsely populated by a <em>wide number of diverse cultures with different social
                organizations</em>. The first group are <strong>basic</strong> hunters and food gatherers such as the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selk%27nam_people">Selknam</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahgan_people">Yaghan</a> in the extreme
                south. The second group were more <strong>advanced</strong> hunters which include the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puelche_people">Puelche</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Querand%C3%AD">Querandí</a>
                and Serranos in the centre-east; and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehuelche_people">Tehuelche</a> in the south. The last group are
                <em>farmers</em> like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charr%C3%BAa">Charrúa</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charr%C3%BAa">Minuane</a>
                and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaran%C3%AD_people">Guaraní</a> in the northeast.</p>

                <p><p>Europeans first arrived in Argentina with the 1502 voyage of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amerigo_Vespucci_(explorer)">Amerigo Vespucci</a>. The Spanish navigators <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_D%C3%ADaz_de_Sol%C3%ADs">Juan Díaz de Solís</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Cabot_(explorer)">Sebastian Cabot</a> visited the territory that is now Argentina in 1516 and 1526, respectively.</p>

                <p>Further colonization efforts came from <strong>Paraguay</strong>, establishing the <em>Governorate of the Río de la Plata—Peru</em> and <em>Chile</em>.
                    Francisco de Aguirre founded Santiago del Estero in 1553. Londres was founded in 1558; Mendoza, in 1561; San Juan, in 1562; San Miguel de Tucumán, in 1565.
                    Juan de Garay founded Santa Fe in 1573 and the same year Jerónimo Luis de Cabrera set up Córdoba. Garay went further south to re-found Buenos Aires in 1580.
                    San Luis was established in 1596.</p>

                <p>The 1810 May Revolution replaced the viceroy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltasar_Hidalgo_de_Cisneros">Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros</a> with the
                    <strong>First Junta</strong>, a new government in Buenos Aires composed by locals. In the first clashes of the Independence War the Junta crushed a
                    royalist counter-revolution in Córdoba, but failed to overcome those of the Banda Oriental, Upper Peru and Paraguay, which later became independent
                    states.

                <p>The French-Argentine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippolyte_Bouchard">Hippolyte Bouchard</a> brought his fleet to wage war against Spain overseas and attacked <strong>Spanish California</strong>, <strong>Spanish Chile</strong>, <strong>Spanish Peru</strong> and <strong>Spanish Philippines</strong>. He secured the allegiance of escaped Filipinos in San Blas who defected from the Spanish to join the Argentine navy, due to common Argentine and Philippine grievances against Spanish colonization. At a later date, the Argentine Sun of May was adopted as a symbol by the Filipinos in the Philippine Revolution against Spain. He also secured the diplomatic recognition of Argentina from King Kamehameha I of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Historian Pacho O&#39;Donnell affirms that Hawaii was the first state that recognized Argentina&#39;s independence.</p>

                <p>Revolutionaries split into two antagonist groups: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitarian_Party">Centralists</a> and the
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federales_(Argentina)">Federalists</a>, a move that would define Argentina&#39;s first decades of independence.</p>

                <p>Some of the most important figures of Argentinean independence made a proposal known as the Inca plan of 1816, which proposed that United Provinces
                    of the Río de la Plata (Present Argentina) should be a monarchy, led by a descendant of the Inca. Juan Bautista Túpac Amaru (half-brother of Túpac Amaru II)
                    was proposed as monarch. Some examples of those who supported this proposal were Manuel Belgrano, José de San Martín and Martín Miguel de Güemes.
                    The Congress of Tucumán finally decided to reject the Inca plan, creating instead a republican, centralist state.</p>
