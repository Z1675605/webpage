            <p>Benefiting from rich natural resources, a highly literate population, a diversified industrial base, and an export-oriented agricultural sector,
                the economy of Argentina is Latin America&#39;s <strong>third-largest</strong>, and the <strong>second largest</strong> in South America.
                It has a &quot;very high&quot; rating on the Human Development Index and a relatively high GDP per capita, with a considerable internal market size and a
                growing share of the high-tech sector.</p>
            
                <p>Access to biocapacity in Argentina is <em>much higher</em> than world average. In 2016, Argentina had 6.8 global hectares of biocapacity per person within
                    its territory, much more than the world average of 1.6 global hectares per person. In 2016 Argentina used 3.4 global hectares of biocapacity per
                    person – their ecological footprint of consumption. This means they use half as much biocapacity as Argentina contains. As a result, Argentina is
                    running a biocapacity reserve. A middle emerging economy and one of the world&#39;s top developing nations, is a member of the G-20 major economies.</p>

            <p>Historically, however, its economic performance has been very uneven, with high economic growth alternating with severe recessions, income maldistribution
                and—in the recent decades—increasing poverty. Early in the 20th century Argentina achieved development, and became the world&#39;s seventh richest country.
                Although managing to keep a place among the top fifteen economies until mid-century, it suffered a long and steady decline, but it is still a high income
                country.</p>
